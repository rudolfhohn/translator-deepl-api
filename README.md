# translator-deepl-api
Webhook services for API.ai project TranslatorDeepL.

This repo is part of a translation bot project. At this time, the bot can be used on [Telegram as TranslatorDeepLBot](http://t.me/TranslatorDeepLBot). The translation itself uses the library [pydeepl](https://github.com/EmilioK97/pydeepl) that takes advantage of the deepl.com translating service.

Services are hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com).
